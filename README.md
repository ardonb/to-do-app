## About The Project

This is a super simple to-do app built using Java (Spring Boot) as the primary programming language, H2 as a database, and  Thymeleaf to create the user interface. All basic crud operations are implemented.</br>

You can view all the tasks, create a new one, edit and delete tasks.
